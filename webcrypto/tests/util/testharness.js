// This file contains a partial adaptation of the testharness.js implementation from
// the W3C WebCrypto API test suite. It is not intended to be a complete
// implementation, but rather a minimal set of functions to support the
// tests for this extension.
//
// Some of the function have been modified to support the k6 javascript runtime,
// and to limit its dependency to the rest of the W3C WebCrypto API test suite internal
// codebase.
//
// The original testharness.js implementation is available at:
// https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt/blob/3a3453c62176c97ab51cd492553c2dacd24366b1/resources/testharness.js
